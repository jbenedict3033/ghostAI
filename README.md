### <br/>Summary<br/>
ghostAI is an artificial intelligence project. The goal is to design an AI for the ghosts in Pac Man that is superior to the original _Midway_ game. In addition, the ideal AI is both efficient and scalable.<br/><br/>
Right now, a working game has been implemented with an AI that is legitimately effective at chasing and trapping a user-controlled Pac Man. However, the game is too different from the original in the controls and environment dynamics to make a direct comparison. In addition, there are a couple bugs that can unexectedly change how the player moves. There are also possible optimizations in the code. Finally, the code itself could be organized and commented better.<br/br/>
That said, this project is still underway and will continue to get better over time.<br/>
### Deliverables<br/>
The ghostAI folder contains four folders and two files.

###### Folders
- _code_ -        contains all the .cpp and .hpp files written specifically for the project
- _graphics_      contains .bmp files that the project uses as textures for the background and sprites
- _levels_        contains .txt files that are translated into level layouts
- _objects_       empty when downloaded, but holds object files when the associated makefile is used

###### Files
- _makefile_      builds the project and drops the executable into the ghostAI folder
- _SDL2.dll_      contains the SDL2 library required for the project to run
