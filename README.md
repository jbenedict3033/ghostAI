### Summary

ghostAI is an artificial intelligence project. The goal is to design an AI for the ghosts in Pac Man that is superior to the original _Midway_ game. In addition, the ideal AI is both efficient and scalable.

Right now, a working game has been implemented with an AI that is legitimately effective at chasing and trapping a user-controlled Pac Man. However, the game is too different from the original in the controls and environment dynamics to make a direct comparison. In addition, there are a couple bugs that can unexectedly change how the player moves. There are also possible optimizations in the code. Finally, the code itself could be organized and commented better.

That said, this project is still underway and will continue to get better over time.
